## Usage ##

The .py file contains the needed functions as well as an example of their usage. I'll implement a more elegant method of input later, but for now, I find it suitable to simply copy an output from your SOAR function, or an example schema of an output from the API's documentation, and save it as a variable. Then, pass the variable into the functions as shown in the file.
